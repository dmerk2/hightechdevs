Here at <a title="High Tech Devs Blog" href="http://hightechdevs.com/blog" rel="">High Tech Web Design</a>, we see a LOT of bad websites. This is because most coders fail to learn proper design skills, and most designers fail to get good at coding. Given the alternative of hiring someone else, these problems are brushed under the rug, leaving the website littered with problems.

If you regularly avoid these 4 common <strong>web design mistakes</strong>, you can rest assured that your sites are ahead of the curve. If you don't, no worries -- your newfound awareness will help you avoid making these mistakes in the future.
<h3>1. Unresponsive text/photos</h3>
<img class="alignleft wp-image-700 size-medium" title="unresponsive design" src="http://www.hightechdevs.com/wp-content/uploads/responsive-vs-unresponsive-website-1-300x225.jpg" alt="unresponsive" width="300" height="225" />

Websites that display poorly on mobile devices are <em>everywhere.</em> This is bad news for the people who designed them, because <em>most</em> visitors to a website will be using their phones. If the page doesn't display properly, or at least legibly, users will be quick to leave.

The problem here is typically laziness on the part of the programmer. It is <em>not </em>difficult (for a developer) to make a website responsive. It just takes some extra time. If you are coding from scratch using CSS, you can use <a title="css tricks media queries" href="https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/media-queries-for-standard-devices/" rel="">media queries</a> to change properties based on the size of the viewport. Relative <a title="CSS Units" href="https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_units.asp" rel="">CSS units</a> like em, vw and vh can be used to change an element's size relative to other length properties (like the size of the viewport). Given these techniques, there is NO EXCUSE for having a website that is hard to read on a mobile device.

<h3>2. Poor color schemes</h3>

Seriously, if you don't have an eye for colors, you need to develop it. You should at least learn basic rules about color combining. But you don't have time to do that, you can try using a color scheme generator.

My favorite is <a title="Web Design Colors" href="https://coolors.co" rel="">coolors.co</a>. It will automatically generate color schemes at the click of a button, for free.

<h3>3. Slow loading time</h3>
Unfortunately, people aren't willing to wait 10 seconds foryour page to load. The poor load time <em>already</em> gives off a sketchy vibe; they won't always wait around to see what comes next. One of the biggest culprits for this is having unoptimized images on your site. If your image is a PNG, you can export it as a JPEG, which will often be much smaller. If not, try exporting it with reduced image quality, as long as you are careful not to go too far. This takes off a LOT of size without taking away much image quality.

Also, if your images are full size from a camera, they are probably way too big. Simply resize them in software like Preview (Mac), Photoshop or GIMP. You might need to do some more research on image optimization in special cases, but for the most part this is enough.

If you're coding from scratch, be sure to eliminate any unnecessary or buggy code, and minify your lengthy files. Also be wary of content hosted elsewhere, perhaps provided to you by a CDN, as well as information retrieved using an API. This content may stopped being delivered at any point due to events outside your control. You need to check your site regularly to ensure they don't have any bugs you've been missing.
<h3>4. Bad fonts</h3>
<img class="size-medium wp-image-704 alignleft" src="http://www.hightechdevs.com/wp-content/uploads/badfonts-1-300x217-1.png" alt="" width="300" height="217" />
Unique fonts look great when used well, but the opposite is also true. If your fonts look outdated or inappropriate, they will detract massively from your message. If in doubt, find similar websites and use their fonts. You can inspect the text in your browser's developer tools, and search its CSS rules for 'font-family.' <a title="Google Fonts" href="https://fonts.google.com" rel="">Google has a wonderful selection of fonts</a>, and they're free to use! <span style="font-family: 'Curlz MT'; font-size: 1.5em;">One thing to make sure of is that the font matches the mood of the text.</span> I rest my case.
It is my hope that you found this blog post useful in improving your web design skills.
